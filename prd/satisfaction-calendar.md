Satisfaction Calendar

* User should see a calendar with the current month in which upon clicking the date it should show a small modal with three emojis with happy, neutral and sad face emojis

* If the user already filled the satisfaction for the date then the emoji should be visible instead of the date in the calendar

* I want you to efficiently store this in the database because only the current month data will be retrieved by the user initially upon clicking previous month it should show the previous month data and upon clicking next month it should show the next month data

* I want you to store the happiness score in the number format so that later i want you to use it to generate the chart and graph.
